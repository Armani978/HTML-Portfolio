            <h2> About Myself</h2>
            <img id="aboutme" src="images/aboutme.jpg">
            <p>If you couldn’t tell by the top of this page, my name is Armani Ross. I am 24 years old, a Scorpio, and I am from Massachusetts. I grew up with my two little brothers Colin and Zack, and we are all 5 years of age apart from eachother. I now live in Los Angeles, California and came out west with a mindset of pursuing a new career in programming. I always wanted to work around technology and have been wanting to be able to spend the rest of my life doing that.</p>

            <h2>What is Armani's life like?</h2>
            <img id="gaming" src="images/gaming.jpeg">
            <p>Even though I think I live a boring life, I mostly like to skateboard, make music and play video games. I have been skateboarding on and off for about 12 years and have been trying to get back into it recently but has been hard because I had surgery on my leg last year and I’m re-learning the basics all over again. I still like to make music but mostly for fun nowadays. And video games is something that I have a passion for and spend a lot of my free-time doing. I like to play multiplayer first-person shooters, sports games, games with action and adventure, and I mostly love to play online competitively. Other than those few things I like to do, I don’t do much else, I like having a simple life.</p>

            <h2>Experience with Coding</h2>
            <img id="coding" src="images/coding.jpeg">
            <p>I have minor experience with coding as far as projects I have done, but over the past year I have been learning Python and HTML/CSS by watching videos on YouTube and teaching myself how to code by taking small courses online. Im excited to be able to have this opportunity to take this cohort and expand my knowledge with programming and doing projects. Technology has always been in my life , and I have always been fascinated by it. At 12 years old I was building computers, and was able to mod my Playstation to run emulators on it. So with this experience I feel destined to work in this field</p>
